# Hey Guys, Welcome to the Connect 4 Logic Test!

This is a logic test based on the classic game **Connect 4**. It's not the most logical choice for a technical job interview, but hey, let's roll with it! ðŸ˜…

## What is Connect 4?

If you haven't played it before, Connect 4 is a game where two players take turns dropping their colored discs into a vertical grid. The goal is to be the first to get four of your discs in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Why Connect 4?

Great question! There's no real logical reason why Connect 4 is used for a technical test. Maybe it's to see if you have patience, strategy, and a bit of luck. Or maybe they just wanted to have some fun. Who knows?

## How to Play
